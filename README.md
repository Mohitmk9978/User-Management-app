🧑‍💻 User Management System (Full Stack Application)
📘 Description

This project is a Full Stack User Management System built as part of Task 6: Build a Full Stack Application.
It demonstrates the integration of a frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) with a backend (Node.js, Express, MongoDB) to perform complete CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on user data.

Users can:

➕ Add a new profile

👀 View all existing profiles

✏️ Update user information

❌ Delete a profile

All data is stored in MongoDB, and displayed dynamically in the frontend UI.
Optionally, you can extend this project to include authentication (login/signup) for practice.
